/**

268[M]. Missing Number
 
Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.
For example,
Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.
Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?
 
Notes:
Â·   	Considering the contiguous of the number sequence, here can calculate the sum and compare the expected one with the real one. The difference is the missing number.
