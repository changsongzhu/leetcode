/**
418[M]. Sentence Screen Fitting
Given a rows x cols screen and a sentence represented by a list of words, find how many times the given sentence can be fitted on the screen.
Note:
1.     A word cannot be split into two lines.
2.     The order of words in the sentence must remain unchanged.
3.     Two consecutive words in a line must be separated by a single space.
4.     Total words in the sentence won't exceed 100.
5.     Length of each word won't exceed 10.
6.     1 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 20,000.
 
Example 1:
Input:
rows = 2, cols = 8, sentence = ["hello", "world"]
 
Output:
1
 
Explanation:
hello---
world---
 
The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
